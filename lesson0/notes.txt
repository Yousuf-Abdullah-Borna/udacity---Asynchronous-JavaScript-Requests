Important Methods for Async Requests

1> open() -> which sets the stage and get the required information to make the Requests
2> send() -> sends the request to the server
3>onload() -> function called when an XMLHttpRequest transaction completes successfully
4>callback is the function to be executed when the request completes successfully
5>You might've picked up that onload is called when the response is successful.
6>If something happens with the request and it can't be fulfilled, then we need to use the onerror property
7>When making a request from an API that returns JSON, all we need to do is convert that JSON response into a JavaScript object. We can do that with JSON.parse()
8>Sets the value of an HTTP request header. You must call setRequestHeader()after open(), but before send().
